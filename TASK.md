**Gender-Neutral Language Implementation** ‚úÖ COMPLETED _(Jan 8, 2025)_

- **Comprehensive Content Analysis**: Analyzed all content files across Spanish, English, and Portuguese to identify gender-specific language
- **Crew Member Role Updates**: Updated crew member roles to use inclusive language (Fot√≥grafo/a, Vide√≥grafo/a, Editor/a) in Spanish and Portuguese
- **Content File Updates**: Updated all content files (content-all.json, content-es.json, content-en.json, content-pt.json) with gender-neutral language
- **Service Layer Updates**: Updated form-content.ts service with gender-neutral language
- **Component Updates**: Updated CrewMemberForm.tsx and test files with inclusive language
- **Script Creation**: Created make-gender-neutral.js script for systematic content updates
- **Verification**: Confirmed that all possessive adjectives (tu, seu/sua, your) and pronouns (te, voc√™, you) are already gender-neutral

**Key Findings**:

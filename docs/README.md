## 🗂️ Enhanced Backlog Management Structure

This project uses an enhanced epic-based task management system to reduce context overhead and improve maintainability.

### 📁 File Organization

### 🔄 Epic Lifecycle

1. **Future Epics** → `BACKLOG.md`
2. **Active Epics** → `TASK.md` (2-3 at a time)
3. **Completed Epics** → `COMPLETED.md`

### 📋 File Purposes

#### `TASK.md`

- Contains only **active epics** (2-3 maximum)
- Each epic references a detailed file in `docs/epics/`
- Kept under 500 lines for context efficiency
- Includes quick status summary and navigation

#### `BACKLOG.md`

- Contains **future epics** not yet active
- Organized by category (frontend, admin, etc.)
- Kept under 1000 lines
- Includes priority-based navigation

#### `COMPLETED.md`

- Archives all **completed epics**
- Maintains historical reference
- Includes completion summaries and metrics

#### `docs/epics/`

- Detailed epic files with full context
- Organized by domain (frontend, admin, etc.)
- Follows standardized template structure
- Contains all task details, acceptance criteria, and progress

### 🎯 How to Use

#### For Active Development

1. Check `TASK.md` for current active epics
2. For detailed context, read the referenced epic file
3. Update epic files with progress and discoveries
4. Move completed epics to `COMPLETED.md`

#### For Planning

1. Check `BACKLOG.md` for future epics
2. Review detailed epic files for full context
3. Move epics to active status when ready to start

#### For Reference

1. Use `COMPLETED.md` for historical reference
2. Check epic files for detailed implementation notes
3. Use cross-references between related epics

### 📊 Benefits

- **Improved Traceability**: Reference system maintains full context
- **Easier Maintenance**: Smaller, focused files are easier to manage
- **Better Collaboration**: Clear separation between active and archived work

### 🔧 Maintenance Rules

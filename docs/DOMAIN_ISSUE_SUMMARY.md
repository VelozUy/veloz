## 🔍 Issue Identified

**Problem**: `www.veloz.com.uy` works correctly, but `veloz.com.uy` (apex domain) has SSL certificate issues.

**Root Cause**: The apex domain (`veloz.com.uy`) is not properly configured in Netlify, causing SSL certificate provisioning to fail.

## 📊 Current Status

### ✅ Working Correctly

- `https://www.veloz.com.uy` - Status: 200 ✅
- `http://www.veloz.com.uy` - Redirects to HTTPS ✅
- `http://veloz.com.uy` - Redirects to HTTPS ✅

### ❌ Not Working

- `https://veloz.com.uy` - SSL Certificate Error (TLS internal error) ❌

## 🔧 Solution Steps

### 1. Immediate Action Required

**Add the apex domain to Netlify:**

1. Go to [Netlify Dashboard](https://app.netlify.com)
2. Navigate to your site settings
3. Go to **Domain Management**
4. Click **Add custom domain**
5. Add `veloz.com.uy` (without www)
6. Click **Verify** to check DNS configuration

### 2. DNS Configuration (Already Correct)

The DNS is properly configured:

```bash
# Apex domain points to Netlify
dig veloz.com.uy A
# Returns: 99.83.190.102, 75.2.60.5 ✅

# WWW subdomain points to Netlify
dig www.veloz.com.uy CNAME
# Returns: perros-y-liebres.netlify.app ✅
```

### 3. Netlify Configuration (Updated)

The `netlify.toml` file has been updated with proper redirect rules:

```toml
# Redirect non-www to www for SEO and consistency
[[redirects]]
  from = "https://veloz.com.uy/*"
  to = "https://www.veloz.com.uy/:splat"
  status = 301
  force = true

# Redirect HTTP to HTTPS
[[redirects]]
  from = "http://veloz.com.uy/*"
  to = "https://www.veloz.com.uy/:splat"
  status = 301
  force = true

[[redirects]]
  from = "http://www.veloz.com.uy/*"
  to = "https://www.veloz.com.uy/:splat"
  status = 301
  force = true
```

### 4. SSL Certificate Provisioning

After adding the domain to Netlify:

1. **Wait 24-48 hours** for automatic SSL certificate provisioning
2. Monitor the **HTTPS** status in Netlify domain settings
3. The certificate will be automatically generated by Let's Encrypt

### 5. Expected Results After Fix

Once the SSL certificate is provisioned:

```
✅ https://www.veloz.com.uy/ - Status: 200 (direct access)
✅ https://veloz.com.uy/ - Status: 301 (redirects to www)
✅ http://www.veloz.com.uy/ - Status: 301 (redirects to https)
✅ http://veloz.com.uy/ - Status: 301 (redirects to https)
```

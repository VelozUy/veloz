## 🎨 Theme Architecture

### Core Components

```
src/
├── app/
│   ├── globals.css              # Theme CSS variables (OKLCH)
│   └── api/theme/route.ts       # Theme API endpoint
├── lib/
│   ├── theme-utils.ts           # Theme utilities and hooks
│   └── theme-consistency-checker.ts  # Theme validation
└── components/
    └── ui/                      # shadcn/ui components
```

### Color System

The theme uses OKLCH color space for:

- **Precise color control**: Better color accuracy than RGB/HSL
- **Accessibility**: Easier to maintain contrast ratios
- **Consistency**: Predictable color relationships

#### Color Categories

- **Primary**: Main brand color for CTAs and important actions
- **Secondary**: Supporting UI elements
- **Muted**: Subtle backgrounds and borders
- **Accent**: Highlighting and focus states
- **Destructive**: Error states and dangerous actions

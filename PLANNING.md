🏢 Company & App Description

Veloz is a company specialized in capturing moments from events — social, corporate, cultural, and beyond — through high-quality photo and audiovisual documentation. What makes Veloz unique is its production model: it breaks down the entire workflow (client intake, shooting, curation, editing, delivery) into specialized roles, handled by different professionals. This results in faster delivery, higher quality, and better scalability than traditional freelance-only models.

The web application’s primary goal is to communicate Veloz’s professionalism and warmth through a visually elegant and intuitive experience. It enables visitors to preview the work, understand the values behind the brand, and submit a service request without friction. Internally, it includes a custom admin panel (CMS) to allow the team to update content and media easily, while supporting multiple languages.

## 🧱 Overall Architecture

- **Frontend**: Next.js 15 (App Router)
- **Hosting**: Netlify
- **Backend** (Headless style):
  - Firebase Firestore → for content data (texts, images, videos)
  - Firebase Auth → to manage admin login
  - Firebase Storage → optional for image/video uploads

## 🎨 Aesthetic Guidelines

- Core brand concepts: _Elegance, Warmth, Effectiveness, Optimization, Agility, Boldness_
- Smooth animations: **Framer Motion**
- Styling framework: **Tailwind CSS** with **shadcn/ui** components
- Icons: **Lucide Icons** (clean and customizable)
- UI Components: **shadcn/ui** → High-quality, accessible components built on Radix UI

### 🎨 Theme System & Color Consistency

**CRITICAL RULE**: All components and pages MUST use the theme color system defined in `tailwind.config.ts` and `globals.css`.

**NEVER use hard-coded Tailwind colors like:**

- ❌ `slate-50`, `slate-100`, `blue-600`, `purple-500`, etc.
- ❌ `text-slate-800`, `bg-white`, `border-gray-200`, etc.

**ALWAYS use theme variables:**

- ✅ `background`, `foreground` for main colors
- ✅ `primary`, `primary-foreground` for brand colors
- ✅ `card`, `card-foreground` for card backgrounds
- ✅ `muted`, `muted-foreground` for secondary text
- ✅ `accent`, `accent-foreground` for highlights
- ✅ `border` for borders
- ✅ `destructive`, `destructive-foreground` for error states

**Benefits:**

- Automatic light/dark mode support
- Consistent brand colors across the entire application
- Easy theme updates and maintenance
- Better accessibility with proper contrast ratios

## 🌍 Multilanguage Support ✅ COMPLETED

- **Static Localized Routes Implementation**: Build-time content generation for SEO optimization
- **Supported Languages**: Spanish (es - base), English (en), Portuguese (pt)
- **Build-Time Data Fetching**: `scripts/build-data.js` fetches all admin-editable content from Firestore
- **Static Content Generation**: Generates `content-es.json`, `content-en.json`, `content-pt.json` in `src/data/`
- **TypeScript Integration**: Auto-generated types in `src/lib/static-content.generated.ts`
- **Content Access**: `getStaticContent()` utility function for accessing localized content
- **SEO Benefits**: All content rendered at build time for optimal search engine crawlability
- **Performance**: No client-side translation loading, faster page loads
- **Future Ready**: Foundation prepared for full locale routing (/en, /es, /pt) implementation

### 4. **Work With Us** (Contact Form)

## Contact Form Planning for Photo & Video Service Website

### Goal

Create a contact form that:

- Is friendly and non-intrusive
- Collects just enough information to respond effectively
- Feels conversational and trustworthy

### Recommended Fields

| Field              | Type               | Required | Notes                                                            |
| ------------------ | ------------------ | -------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Name               | Short text         | Yes      | Adds a human touch to the conversation                           |
| Email              | Email              | Yes      | Main method of contact                                           |
| Event Type         | Dropdown / Buttons | Yes      | Options: Wedding, 15th Birthday, Birthday, Corporate, Other      |

| Message / Comments | Textarea           | No       | Prompt: "Tell us about your idea, location, number of guests..." |

### Button Text Suggestions

Avoid cold "Send" buttons. Use warmer CTAs like:

- "I want you at my event"

### Extra (Optional) Fields

Only include if useful:

- Phone (only if you plan to use it)
- How did you find us?

### Microcopy for Trust

Below the form or submit button:

> "We don’t share your info. We’ll only reach out to help with your event."

### Design Tips

- Keep validation minimal (only name and email required)
- Friendly placeholder text to inspire the user
- Use padding, icons, and soft colors to make the form feel approachable

## Interactive CTA Widget (Sticky Button Micro-Survey)

### Objective

Replace the classic top navbar "Contact" link with a **floating sticky button** that opens a conversational micro-survey, guiding users toward the right action in a friendly and engaging way.

### Behavior Flow

1. **Sticky Button** (desktop & mobile):
   - Visible on all pages
   - Text: `¿En qué evento estás pensando?`
   - Position: bottom-right corner, high z-index

2. **On Click → Open Micro-Survey:**

#### Step 1: Event Type

- Options: `Boda`, `Empresarial`, `Otro`

#### Step 2: Approximate Date

- Options: `Sí` → Date selector / `No`

#### Step 3: Want to tell us more?

- Options:
  - `Sí` → Navigate to `/contacto?evento=boda&fecha=2025-09-01`
    - URL query pre-fills form
    - Focus on textarea input
  - `Quiero que me llamen` → Show phone number input + send button

3. **If "Quiero que me llamen" is selected:**
   - Show phone number field
   - Show submit button
   - Send via email or save in database/API (e.g., Firebase)

### Technical Requirements

- Component built in **React + Tailwind CSS**
- Must support **query params** on contact page to pre-fill fields
- Responsive on all screen sizes
- Accessible and performant

This component improves user interaction and encourages conversions through a conversational, low-friction approach.

### Build Process Integration

```bash
npm run build        # Runs build:data then next build
npm run build:data   # Fetches all content from Firestore and generates static files
```

### Static Content Structure

The build script generates:

- `src/data/content-es.json` - Spanish content (base language)
- `src/data/content-en.json` - English translations
- `src/data/content-pt.json` - Portuguese translations
- `src/lib/static-content.generated.ts` - TypeScript definitions

Each content file includes:

- Homepage content (headlines, CTAs, media URLs)
- FAQ items with categories and translations
- Projects data with multilingual metadata
- Build metadata and timestamps

## 🧪 Dev Utilities & Tooling

- **shadcn/ui** → High-quality components built on Radix UI with excellent accessibility
- **React Hook Form** → Performant forms with easy validation (works great with shadcn/ui)
- **Framer Motion** → transitions for modals, page entrances
- **Zod** → schema validation for forms and CMS
- **Husky** → pre-commit hooks
- **ESLint + Prettier** → code style enforcement
- **Netlify CI/CD** → auto-deploy from GitHub

⚠️ Important: Use shadcn/ui components whenever possible for the React frontend. Do not create custom UI components from scratch unless necessary. Assume shadcn/ui is already installed and configured. Use components like <Button>, <Input>, <Textarea>, <Label>, <Card>, <Badge>, <Tabs>, etc.

## 📌 Next Steps

1. Design low-fidelity wireframes (Landing, FAQ, Gallery, Contact, Admin)
2. Set up Firebase project: Firestore rules, Auth providers, Storage bucket
3. Scaffold `/admin` layout with Firebase Auth and sidebar
4. Integrate Firestore reads/writes for one content type (FAQ)
5. Configure `i18next` with basic translation loading
6. Set up domain veloz.com.uy in Netlify DNS
7. Define image/video hosting strategy (Cloudinary vs Firebase Storage)
